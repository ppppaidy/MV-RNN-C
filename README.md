# MV-RNN-C
MV-RNN written in C

This is an implementation of MV-RNN written in C.

The interfaces are in `classifyRelations`.

The origin works are written in matlab and stored in `deepDualCamera`, and the origin README is in `README_old.txt`.

The C programs are in `myRNNC`.

Please enter `classifyRelations` and use `sh ./myClassifyRelations <inputFile> <outputFile>.mat` to run the test.

The "train" and "test\_with\_external\_feature" has not been written yet.

Data are too big, so I do not upload them. You can find them in http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/relationClassification.zip/
